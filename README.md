# etch-a-sketch
This is a project from the Odin Project. A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch is to be built.
The drawing is started by double-clicking on the grid and it is stopped again by double-clicking on the grid. Hence, disjoint 
regions can easily be drawn.
